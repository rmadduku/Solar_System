The inspiration for this project was the solar system and implementing it in OpenGL. I successfully implemented the tilt of the planets, orbits, and rotation speeds. They all follow their real-life equivalents. As a result aside from the sun, every object is to scale. However, there is a #if 0/1 that can be toggled to allow for the planets to be disproportionate and allow for easier viewing. I wanted to implement a comet that could orbit in an elliptical orbit and asteroids that were random surfaces of revolution. However, I ran out of time to finish the assignment. The keyboard allows for “A, S, D, E” for ambient, specular, diffuse, and emissive lighting. “HOME, END” for zooming in and out. The arrow keys allow for tilting the viewpoint. Lastly, Y and U allow for speeding up and slowing down the animation. As for the cool things I implemented. I gave the Earth and Mars their moons. I also made Saturn’s rings that always tilt away from the sun. In fact, all the planets demonstrated seasons and showed that they had days. I applied texture maps to all the planets and used Paint 3D to edit a lot of the bitmaps so that they wouldn’t show seams when used.
